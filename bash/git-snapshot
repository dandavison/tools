    #   Write a shell script, to be named git-snapshot. It will do the following:
    # - Take the current branch name.
    # - Prefix it with "z-"
    # - Suffix it with "-$n" where n is an integer satisfying the following: it is the smallest
    #   integer such that no branch with the name exists already.
    # - Use git branch -c to create a snapshot copy of the current branch, with the name you've
    #   constructed. Print out the branch name created (or even better, perhaps git branch has a
    #   "verbose" flag you can use for that purpose.

    # Get the current branch name
    local current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

    # Prefix and base for the snapshot branch
    local prefix="z-"
    local suffix_base="-"

    # Find the smallest integer n for which the branch name doesn't exist
    local n=1
    while git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/"$prefix$current_branch$suffix_base$n"; do
        n=$((n + 1))
    done

    # Construct the new branch name
    local new_branch="$prefix$current_branch$suffix_base$n"

    # Create the snapshot branch
    git branch -c "$current_branch" "$new_branch"

    # Output the name of the created branch
    echo "Created branch: $new_branch"
